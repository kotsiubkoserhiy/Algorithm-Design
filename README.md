# Algorithm-Design

## Task 1

Algorithms of external sorting.
Balanced multipath fusion and modified balanced multipath fusion algorithm.

Instructions for starting the main program.

Prerequisites:
- make sure that you have Python and IDE installed (for example, I use Pycharm)

Installation:
- Clone this repository to your local computer
- Open in Pycharm (IDE)
- Click on the main.py file and the Run "main.py" button
- After starting the program, select the sorting algorithm in the console (Balanced Multipath Merge or Modified Balanced Multipath Merge Algorithm)
- Enter the size of the input file in bytes
- After sorting, the program displays the sorting time by the selected algorithm.

Instructions for launching unit tests:
- The repository is already cloned and PyCharm is open (IDE)
- Click on the test_balanced_multiway_merge_sort.py file and the Run " test_balanced_multiway_merge_sort.py" button
- In the console, you will notice the success of three tests (positive - sorting operation with correct data, negative - an attempt to sort a file that does not exist, with limit values - the minimum value is 10 MB or 10000000 bytes)

## Task 2

Non-informative, informative and local search
BFS and A* algorithms.

Instructions for starting the main program.

Prerequisites:
- make sure that you have Python and IDE installed (for example, I use Pycharm)

Installation:
- Clone this repository to your local computer
- Open in Pycharm (IDE)
- Click on the EightQueensSolve_main.py file and the Run "EightQueensSolve_main.py" button
- After starting the program, select the algorithm in the console (BFS or A* algorithms)
- After execution, the program will display the found solutions in the console

Instructions for launching unit tests:
- The repository is already cloned and PyCharm is open (IDE)
- Click on unit_tests.py file and the Run "EightQueensSolve_unit_tests.py" button
- In the console, you will notice the success of three tests (positive - the size of the board is 4, negative - the size of the board is 0, boundary - the size of the board is 1)

## Task 3

Design of data structures. Dense-indexed files with index-space rearrangement, uniform binary search

Instructions for starting the main program.

Prerequisites:
- make sure that you have Python and IDE installed (for example, I use Pycharm)

Installation:
- Clone this repository to your local computer
- Open in Pycharm (IDE)
- Click on the main.py file and the Run "main.py" button
- Search for a record: In the "Search Key" field, enter the key of the record you want to find. Click the "Search" button. The search result will be displayed in the text box below.
- Adding a record: In the "Add Key" field, enter the key of the record you want to add or edit. In the "Data" field, enter the data you want to associate with this key. Click the "Add" button. A message about the successful addition of the record will appear in the text field at the bottom.
- Editing a record: In the "Edit Key" field, enter the key of the record you want to add or edit. In the "Data" field, enter the data you want to associate with this key. Click the "Edit" button. A message will appear in the text field below about the successful editing of the record.
- Deleting a record: In the "Edit Key" field, enter the key of the record you want to delete. Click the "Delete" button. A message about the successful deletion of the record will appear in the text field below.
- Quit the program: Just close the program window.

Instructions for launching unit tests:
- The repository is already cloned and PyCharm is open (IDE)
- Click on unit_tests.py file and the Run "unit_tests.py" button
- In the console, you will notice the success of three tests.

## Task 4

Design and analysis of algorithms for solving NP-complex problems part 1. The task of the traveling salesman. Ant's algorithm

Instructions for starting the main program.

Prerequisites:
- make sure that you have Python and IDE installed (for example, I use Pycharm)

Installation:
- Clone this repository to your local computer
- Open in Pycharm (IDE)
- Click on the main.py file and the Run "main.py" button
- Enter the required number of iterations. 
- After that, you will get the best path length and a graph showing the dependence of the solution on the number of iterations

Instructions for launching unit tests:
- The repository is already cloned and PyCharm is open (IDE)
- Click on unit_tests.py file and the Run "unit_tests.py" button
- In the console, you will notice the success of three tests.
